The video format is a variant of Motion JPEG, with fixed rather than variable division tables. The audio format is a variant of IMA ADPCM. The first 8 bytes of each frame are origin, index, and several encoded 16-bit samples; usually, the AMV files play sound at 22050 samples/second. The AMV video is a compressed but low resolution (96x96 to 320x240 pixel), which can be played on the desktop using any media player software.",

Other extensions such as .m2ts also exist specifying the accurate container, in this case, MPEG-2 TS, but this has little pertinence to MPEG-1 media. The .mp3 is the most common extension for files containing MP3 audio. An MP3 file is a typical stream of raw audio; the traditional way to tag MP3 files is by writing stream data to &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; segments of each frame, which save the media information but are discarded by the mpg file player. This is a similar technique used to tag the AAC files, but less supported nowadays.",
