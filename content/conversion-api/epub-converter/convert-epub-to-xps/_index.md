## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 provides the simplest API to convert {{%EPUB%}} documents to {{%XPS%}} format with high quality, easy and fast. 

The EPUB format has gained popularity as an XML-based e-book format and designed to adapt the content's presentation to the reader device. It is implemented as an archive file consisting of XHTML files carrying the content, images and other supporting files. 

The article explains in a set of code examples how to convert an EPUB document to XPS using Aspose.HTML Cloud client SDKs and REST API calls. We will consider various scenarios of EPUB to XPS conversion. SDKs are available in PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python, C#, Java, Android, Swift and more.

## **SDK Examples of EPUB to XPS Conversion**

A widespread use case for Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK functions is file processing and converting. Cloud APIs allows you to fetch an EPUB document from a storage location by its name or a local file on your drive, convert it to a specified format and save it to the storage or a local drive. The following code examples demonstrate how to convert EPUB to XPS for different cases using available SDKs and cURL.

### **Example 1.**  Convert a local EPUB file to XPS and save the result to local path

{{< tabs tabTotal="10" tabID="1" tabName1="C#"  tabName2="Java" tabName3="C++"  tabName4="Python" tabName5="PHP"  tabName6="Ruby" tabName7="Node.js" tabName8="Swift"  tabName9="Java/Android" tabName10="CURL" >}}

```c#
// Initialize SDK API
var api = new HtmlApi("CLIENT_ID", "CLIENT_SECRET").ConvertApi;

// Convert EPUB to XPS
var result = await api.ConvertAsync("test.epub", "test.xps");
