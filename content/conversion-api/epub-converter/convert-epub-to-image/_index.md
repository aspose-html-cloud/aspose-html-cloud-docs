## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 provides the simplest API to convert {{%EPUB%}} documents to Image file formats with high quality, easy and fast. 

The EPUB format has gained popularity as an XML-based e-book format and designed to adapt the content's presentation to the reader device. It is implemented as an archive file consisting of XHTML files carrying the content, images and other supporting files. Sometimes, it is required to get an image instead of EPUB documents, such as making them portable and easily shared on various devices, creating a picture gallery from eBooks, etc. 

The article explains in a set of code examples how to convert an EPUB document to Image file formats such as {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%GIF%}}, {{%TIFF%}} or {{%BMP%}} using Aspose.HTML Cloud SDKs and REST API calls. SDKs are available in PHP, Perl, Python, C#, Ruby, Java, Android, Swift and more. We will consider various scenarios of EPUB to Image conversion: from storage to storage, from a local file system to the local file system, etc.

## **SDK Examples of EPUB to Image Conversion**

A widespread use case for Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK functions is file processing and converting.  Cloud SDK allows you to fetch an EPUB document from a storage location by its name or a local file on your drive, convert it to a specified format and save it to the storage or a local drive. The following code examples demonstrate how to convert EPUB to JPG for different cases using available SDKs.

### **Example 1.**  Convert a local EPUB file to JPG and save the result to local path

JPG is one of the most commonly used image formats. Its uniqueness is the controlled loss of quality during compression. Therefore, it is widely used to store and send graphic content (photos, scanned copies, digitized images) over the Internet.

The following example demonstrates the simplest way to convert **EPUB to JPG C#** language applying. Local EPUB converted to JPG and saved to the local path. You can download the C# SDK from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-html-cloud/aspose-html-cloud-dotnet).

```c#
// Initialize SDK API
var api = new HtmlApi("CLIENT_ID", "CLIENT_SECRET").ConvertApi;

// Convert EPUB to JPG
var result = await api.ConvertAsync("test.epub", "test.jpg");

### **Example 2.** Convert EPUB from the local file system to PNG with explicitly specified options and save it to the local path

PNG image format widely takes to transmit pictures over the network, display photos and graphics on web-pages and reserve in cloud storages. EPUB to PNG conversion may be required, for example, if you want to add a web page in a PowerPoint presentation, insert it on a blog for your readers, or send it by e-mail. The example below shows how to convert EPUB to PNG with explicitly specified options and save the result back to the local file system.
