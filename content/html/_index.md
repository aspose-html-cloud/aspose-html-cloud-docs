**Welcome to the Aspose.HTML Cloud documentation section**

Aspose.HTML Cloud is a REST API designed explicitly for document generation, manipulation and conversion in the cloud. The REST API is platform-independent and integrates with other cloud services. It provides access to files and folders that are stored in the user associated Aspose cloud storage or any additional cloud storage of your choice. Aspose.HTML Cloud provides the ability to use its functionality both by the REST API directly or by the set of wrappers implemented as SDKs on the various programming languages.

The main highlights of Aspose.HTML Cloud REST API v4.0  are the [conversion feature](/html/conversion-api/) and the [cloud storage access](/html/storage-api/) functionality.

The REST API supports a set of converting between formats. You can take a source document from the cloud storage or a local file system. The following conversions are available:

 - Convert {{%HTML%}} to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%GIF%}}, {{%Markdown%}}, and {{%MHTML%}}. 
 - Convert {{%XHTML%}} to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%GIF%}}, {{%Markdown%}}, and {{%MHTML%}}.
 - Convert {{%EPUB%}} to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, and {{%GIF%}}.
 - Convert {{%MHTML%}} to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%GIF%}}, and {{%HTML%}}.

 - Convert {{%Markdown%}} to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, and {{%GIF%}}.

**SDK example of HTML to PDF conversion**

Convert an HTML document fast and easy with our intuitive API just with a few lines of code. Letâ€™s review the common usage scenario when HTML is stored at a local drive, and you want to convert it to PDF format and save to the storage.

```c#
const string LOCAL_TESTDATA = "d:\TestData";
const string STORAGE_DSTFOLDER = "storage:///Html/TestResult";

var name = "testpage1.html";
var srcFilePath = $"{LOCAL_TESTDATA}\{name}";
var destFolder = $"{STORAGE_DSTFOLDER}/Pdf";

using(var api = new HtmlApi(clientId, clientSecret))
{    
    ConverterBuilder convHtmlPdf = new ConverterBuilder()
        .FromLocalFile(srcFilePath)
        .To(new PDFConversionOptions())
        .SaveToStorage(destFolder);

    ConversionResult result = api.Convert(convHtmlPdf);
    if(result.Status == "success" && result.Files.Length > 0)
    {
        // download file(s) by path result.Files
    }
}
```

Also, our REST API provides capabilities to manipulate files that are stored in the cloud storage associated with user applications, such as:

- Upload and download files to/from the cloud storage.
- Check if a file or folder exists in the storage.
- Get a list of folders and files in the specified storage folder.
- Get a list of versions of the specified file (if the given storage supports file versioning).
- Copy, move and delete files and folders in the cloud storage.
- Check if named storage exists and is accessible to the user and get the storage total and used disc space.
