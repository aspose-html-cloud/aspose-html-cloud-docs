**Welcome to the Aspose.HTML Cloud documentation section**

Aspose.HTML Cloud is a REST API designed explicitly for document generation, manipulation and conversion in the cloud. The REST API is platform-independent and integrates with other cloud services. It provides access to files and folders that are stored in the user associated Aspose cloud storage or any additional cloud storage of your choice. Aspose.HTML Cloud provides the ability to use its functionality both by the REST API directly or by the set of wrappers implemented as SDKs on the various programming languages.
The main highlights of Aspose.HTML Cloud REST API v4.0 are the [conversion feature](/html/conversion-api/) and the [cloud storage access](/html/storage-api/) functionality.

The REST API supports a set of converting between formats. You can take a source document from cloud storage or a local file system. The following conversions are available:

 - [Convert HTML](/html/conversion-api/html-converter/) to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%GIF%}}, {{%Markdown%}}, and {{%MHTML%}}. 
 - [Convert XHTML](/html/conversion-api/) to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%GIF%}}, {{%Markdown%}}, and {{%MHTML%}}.
 - [Convert EPUB](/html/conversion-api/epub-converter/) to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, and {{%GIF%}}.
 - [Convert MHTML](/html/conversion-api/) to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%GIF%}}, and {{%HTML%}}.
 - [Convert Markdown](/html/conversion-api/) to different formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%BMP%}}, and {{%GIF%}}.

**SDK example of HTML to PDF conversion**

Convert an HTML document fast and easy with our intuitive API just with a few lines of code. Letâ€™s review the common usage scenario when HTML is stored at a local drive, and you want to convert it to PDF format and save to the storage.

```c#
// Initialize SDK API
var api = new HtmlApi("CLIENT_ID", "CLIENT_SECRET").ConvertApi;

// Convert HTML to PDF
var result = await api.ConvertAsync("test.html", "test.pdf");
```

Also, our REST API provides capabilities to manipulate files that are stored in the cloud storage associated with user applications, such as:

- Upload and download files to/from the cloud storage.
- Check if a file or folder exists in the storage.
- Get a list of folders and files in the specified storage folder.
- Check if named storage exists and is accessible to the user and get the storage total and used disc space.
