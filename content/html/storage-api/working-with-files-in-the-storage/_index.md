## **REST API**

The Aspose.HTML Cloud API is a REST-based API for wide usability on the web across platforms. A call to the REST API consists of a client's request, and a response returned by the service. In the request, you send a URL with information about which operation you want to call, the resource to act upon, query parameters, etc.
