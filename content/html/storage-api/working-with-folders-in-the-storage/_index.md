## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud allows you to work with documents saved on the cloud storage and use the storage for various scenarios. The most common use cases are cloud backup, disaster recovery and archiving infrequently accessed data. Having your files in the cloud storage will also give you the ability to share it with friends or co-workers.

 Storage services enable developers to store data in the cloud, relying on the authentication and other access features that control who can get to the data.  If you need any information getting started with Aspose.HTML Cloud, please refer to the [Create an Account and Get Credentials](/html/create-an-account-and-get-credentials/) article.

 This article provides a detailed description of REST API operations to manipulate files in the cloud storage, i.e. upload, download, copy, move or delete files. If storage supports file versioning, it is an option to operate with a specified file version.



## **Cloud SDK family**

Cloud storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of data at any time. Aspose.HTML provides the [Cloud SDK Family](https://products.aspose.cloud/html/family) to access files and folders stored in the user associated Aspose Cloud Storage or any other Cloud Storage of your choice. If you need any help getting started with setting third party storage please refer to [Aspose Cloud UI Help Topics](https://docs.aspose.cloud/total/aspose-cloud-ui-help-topics/).

## **REST API Description**

REST API is one of the most common web services available today. It can be called from any platform that supports HTTP / HTTPS and it does not depend on the software running on the server or client.

The action must be recorded by the HTTP request method that you make. The most common methods include GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. More detailed information about REST URLsâ€™ structure and specific behavior linked to the API such as Authentication, Request Queuing, and Storage you can find in the [REST API Overview](https://docs.aspose.cloud/total/getting-started/rest-api-overview/) article.
