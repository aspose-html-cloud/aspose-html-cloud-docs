## **Deprecated REST API**

The actual version of Aspose.HTML Cloud REST API is v.4.0. Old-style REST API v.3.0 is still available, but its features will be moved step by step to API v.4.0. They are not recommended to use now.

Documentation pages of API v.3.0 are available [here](https://docs.aspose.cloud/html/archive_v_3_0).

## **Cloud SDKs**
Cloud SDKs are wrappers around REST APIs in various programming languages, allowing you to process documents in the language of your choice quickly and easily, gaining all benefits of strong types and IDE highlights. Please check [Aspose.HTML GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-html-cloud/) for SDKs with working examples to get you started in no time.
