## **Summary**

The {{%EPUB%}} file type is an eBook standard or interchange format for digital publications and documents based on web standards. The format is so common by now, it is supported by almost every e-reader and can be viewed on portable devices, mobile phones, and desktop computers.

Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 provides the straightforward API for documents' conversion between formats with high quality, easy and fast. This article demonstrates how to convert an EPUB file to {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%JPEG%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%TIFF%}},  and {{%GIF%}}, using SDKs.
