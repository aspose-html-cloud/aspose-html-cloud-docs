## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 provides the simplest API to convert  {{%EPUB%}} documents to {{%DOCX%}} format with high quality, easy and fast. EPUB is an open XML-based format for digital books and publications, which can be viewed and read on smartphones, tablets and computers. Microsoft Word files including DOCX and DOC are also famous because of various features. You can convert EPUB files to DOCX or DOC files, with great fidelity. 

The article explains in a set of code examples how to convert an EPUB document to DOCX/DOC using Aspose.HTML Cloud client SDKs and REST API. We will consider various scenarios of EPUB to DOCX conversion: from storage to storage, from a local file system to the storage and from the storage to a local file system.

## **Examples of EPUB to DOCX Conversion**

A widespread use case for Aspose.HTML Cloud functions is file processing and converting.  Cloud SDKs and REST API allow you to fetch an EPUB document from a storage location by its name or a local file on your drive, convert it to a specified format and save it to the storage or a local drive. The following code examples demonstrate how to convert EPUB to DOCX for different cases.

### **Example 1.**  Convert a local EPUB file to DOC and save the result to local path

{{< tabs tabTotal="10" tabID="1" tabName1="C#"  tabName2="Java" tabName3="C++"  tabName4="Python" tabName5="PHP"  tabName6="Ruby" tabName7="Node.js" tabName8="Swift"  tabName9="Java/Android" tabName10="CURL" >}}

3 steps:
- Upload local file to storage using [Storage API](https://docs.aspose.cloud/html/storage-api/working-with-files-in-the-storage)
- Call REST API to execute conversion (in the example bellow)
- Download conversion result back from storage using [Storage API](https://docs.aspose.cloud/html/storage-api/working-with-files-in-the-storage)
```bash
curl -X POST -v \
	"https://api.aspose.cloud/v4.0/html/conversion/epub-doc" \
    -d "{'InputPath': '/testpage.epub', 'OutputFile': 'test.doc'}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

### **Example 2** Convert EPUB to DOC inside cloud storage

Aspose.HTML Cloud allows you to get an EPUB file from your cloud storage and save conversion result back to cloud storage.

{{< tabs tabTotal="10" tabID="4" tabName1="C#"  tabName2="Java" tabName3="C++"  tabName4="Python" tabName5="PHP"  tabName6="Ruby" tabName7="Node.js" tabName8="Swift"  tabName9="Java/Android" tabName10="CURL" >}}

{{< tab tabNum="1" >}}

```c#
// Initialize 
var api = new HtmlApi("CLIENT_ID", "CLIENT_SECRET").ConvertApi;

// Convert
var builder = new ConverterBuilder()
                .FromStorageFile("/test.epub")
                .ToStorageFile("/test.doc");
                
var result = await api.ConvertAsync(builder);
```
