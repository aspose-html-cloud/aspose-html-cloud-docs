## **Summary**

This article contains a more detailed description of the conversion API provided by Aspose.HTML Cloud API v4.0.  It explains the following features:

- parameters of the conversion APIs; 
- path format conventions of source and destination paths.

### **Common path format conventions**

The source and result document paths must match the following conventions:

| Protocol    | Template                                                     | Description                                                  |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| http, https | {*protocol*}://*hostname*/[*path*]/[*pagename*.html]         | Only source documents. These paths are valid Web URLs that can represent both static [HTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/html/) pages or dynamic HTML content pages generated by CGI, ASP, JSP, PHP and so on. |
| storage     | storage://[*storageName*]/[*Folder1*]/[*Folder2*]/...*/FileName.ext* - storage file  <br />storage://[*storageName*]/[*Folder1*]/[*Folder2*]/.../[*FolderN*]/ - storage folder | Source and result documents. This type of paths represents files or folders in the Aspose cloud storage associated with the application user. The path specifies the *storageName* (can be empty for user application's default storage) and file/folder full path in the storage. The document lifetime is controlled by the storage associated user. |
| (omitted)   | /[*Folder1*]/[*Folder2*]/...*/FileName.ext* - storage file  <br /> /[*Folder1*]/[*Folder2*]/.../FolderName/ - storage folder | By default, Conversion API treats these paths as a path in the default cloud storage. Storage API uses only such paths, additional *storage* parameter may be specified or not. |
| app       | app:*///[Folder1]/[Folder2]/.../FileName.ext*                | Source and result documents. In a common case, these are results of an operation where outputPath wasn't explicitly specified. This type of paths represents files in the internal temporary storage; they are available for download during a limited time. Generally, they are used internally by client SDKs and can be used by other applications that use Aspose.HTML Cloud API v4.0 directly. |
|             |                                                              |                                                              |

 

### **Conversion API details**

To create a correctly constructed HTTP request, you should build URI relative to https://api.aspose.cloud/v4.0/html.

#### **Initialize asynchronous conversion operation**

- **POST:** start a long-time conversion operation. If succeeded, returns a response with operation ID.

```bash
/convert?inputPath={inputPath}&outputFormat={outputFormat}&outputPath={outputPath}
```

**Parameters:**

| Name         | Description                                                  | Passed in | Required |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :------- |
| inputPath    | Location of a source document to be converted.               | Query     | +        |
| outputFormat | Format the source document will be converted to. Supported values: [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/), [XPS](https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/xps/), [MHTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/mhtml/), [MD](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/md/),  [JPEG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/), [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/), [TIFF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/), [BMP](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/), and [GIF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/). | Query     | +        |
| outputPath   | A location where the conversion result will be saved. <br /> **NOTE:** By default, the result document will be saved to the internal temporary storage (see app:// paths above). | Query     | -        |
| width        | Result document page or image width in points (1/96 inch).   | Body      | -        |
| height       | Result document page or image height in points (1/96 inch).  | Body      | -        |
| leftmargin   | Result document page or image left margin in points (1/96 inch). | Body      | -        |
| rightmargin  | Result document page or image right margin in points (1/96 inch). | Body      | -        |
| topmargin    | Result document page or image top margin in points (1/96 inch). | Body      | -        |
| bottommargin | Result document page or image bottom margin in points (1/96 inch). | Body      | -        |
| resolution   | Resolution of the resulting image. The default is 96 dpi. Applicable only to image formats. | Body      | -        |
| jpegquality  | JPEG image quality, valid values from 0 to 100. The default is 96. Applicable only to JPEG image format. | Body      | -        |
| usegit       | Use GIT flavor of Markdown (false by default). Applicable only to MD format. | Body      | -        |



#### **Check the current status of the conversion operation**

- **GET:** check the previously started operation state by its ID. Returns the state object; if state code is "completed", the response object will contain a list of converted file paths. The conversion results are stored in the cloud storage and will be available for download using cloud paths from the response.

```bash
/convert/{id}
```

**Parameters:**

| Name | Description                                 | Passed in | Required |
| :--- | :------------------------------------------ | :-------- | :------- |
| id   | ID of a conversion task previously started. | Path      | +        |



#### **Cancel a running conversion**

- **DELETE:** cancel the previously started operation by its ID.

```bash
/convert/{id}
```

**Parameters:**

| Name | Description                                 | Passed in | Required |
| :--- | :------------------------------------------ | :-------- | :------- |
| id   | ID of a conversion task previously started. | Path      | +        |
