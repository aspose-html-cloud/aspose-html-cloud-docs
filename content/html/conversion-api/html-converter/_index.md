## **Summary**

File conversion capabilities are a required tool for modern communication, education, business, etc. Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK for .NET offers secure APIs for {{%HTML%}} conversion into popular file formats including {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%DOC%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%JPG%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%GIF%}}, {{%MHTML%}}, and {{%Markdown%}}.

In this documentation chapter, you find out in details on how to convert an HTML file to the most popular formats using Aspose.HTML Cloud SDKs.

Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-html-cloud) for a complete list of Aspose.HTML SDKs along with working examples to get you started in no time. Please check the [Available SDKs](/html/overview/available-sdks/) article to learn how to add an SDK to your project.

Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK family allows converting HTML files to a variety of popular formats using default or custom conversion options. Conversion Options usage enables you to customize the rendering process; you can specify the page size, margins, resolution, compression level, etc. To learn more about Conversion Options, please read the [SDK Conversion Options](html/conversion-api/sdk-conversion-options/) article.
