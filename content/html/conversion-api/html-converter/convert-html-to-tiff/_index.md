## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud produces a few quick and easy ways to convert HTML files to various image formats: by direct REST API calls or using SDKs. There are multiple image formats accessible for converting HTML documents with Aspose.HTML Cloud APIs - {{%TIFF%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%GIF%}}, and {{%TIFF%}}.

This article explains in a set of code examples how to convert an {{%HTML%}} document to {{%TIFF%}} using Aspose.HTML Cloud.


## **SDK Examples of HTML to TIFF Conversion**

Aspose.HTML Cloud allows you to fetch an HTML document from a storage location by its name, from a URL or a local file on your drive, convert it to a specified format and save it to the storage or a local drive. The following code examples demonstrate how to convert HTML to TIFF programmatically for different cases.

## **Example 1.**  Convert a local HTML file to TIFF and save the result to local path

In the example, we use methods of the **ConverterBuilder** class: **FromUrl**(`url`), **To**(`ConversionOptions`) and **SaveToLocalDirectory**(`outputDirectory`) that specify input data, the output format, and the target directory for a conversion result.

HTML to TIFF conversion occurs with the **default conversion options**: the resulting TIFF documentâ€™s width and height correspond to A4, all margins have zero value, and the resolution value is 96 dpi.
