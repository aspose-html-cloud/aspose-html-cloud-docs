## **Summary**

Converting between formats is required for various reasons: to work in a familiar, convenient format or to take advantage of different formats for specific tasks. {{%XPS%}} is a document storage and viewing format developed by Microsoft. An XPS file is a ZIP archive using the Open Packaging Conventions containing the files that make up the document. It has a set of advantages that support security features, such as digital signatures to provide greater document security and more.

This article explains in a set of code examples how to convert {{%HTML%}} to {{%XPS%}} using Aspose.HTML Cloud client SDKs.



## **SDK Examples of HTML to XPS Conversion**

Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK allows you to fetch an HTML document from storage location by its name, from a URL or a local file on your drive, convert it to a specified format and save it to the storage or a local drive. The following code examples demonstrate how to convert HTML to XPS for different cases using available SDKs.

### **Example 1.**  Convert an HTML file from the storage to XPS and save the result to the storage

The conversion process is following - a source document is loaded from the *default* cloud storage, and after conversion is completed, the result is saved to this storage.  The default XPSConversionOptions are applied to the conversion. In the example, we use methods of the **ConverterBuilder** class: **FromStorageFile**(`inputPath`), **To**(`ConversionOptions`) and **SaveToStorage**(`outputDirectory`) that specify input data, the output format and the target directory for a conversion result.

The following example demonstrates how to convert **HTML to XPS C#** language applying. HTML is taken from the storage, converted to XPS and saved to the storage.  You can download the C# SDK from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-html-cloud/aspose-html-cloud-dotnet).

```c#
const string STORAGE_SRCFOLDER = "storage:///Html/TestData";
const string STORAGE_DSTFOLDER = "storage:///Html/TestResult";

var name = "testpage1.html";
var srcFilePath = $"{STORAGE_SRCFOLDER}/{name}";
var destFolder = $"{STORAGE_DSTFOLDER}/Xps";

using(var api = new HtmlApi(clientID, clientSecret)) // initialize SDK API
{
    ConverterBuilder convHtmlXps = new ConverterBuilder()
        .FromStorageFile(srcFilePath)
        .To(new XPSConversionOptions())
        .SaveToStorage(destFolder);

    ConversionResult result = api.Convert(convHtmlXps);
    if(result.Status == "success" && result.Files.Length > 0)
    {
        // download file(s) by path result.Files
    }
}
```

HTML to XPS conversion occurs with the **default conversion options**: the resulting XPS documentâ€™s width and height correspond to A4 and all margins have zero value.

### **Example 2.** Convert HTML from the local file system to XPS with explicitly specified options and save the result to the storage

The example below demonstrates how to convert an HTML file from the local file system to XPS with explicitly specified options and save the result to the cloud storage.

 For conversion, we use methods of the **ConverterBuilder** class: **FromLocalFile**(`inputPath`), **To**(`ConversionOptions`) and **SaveToStorage**(`outputDirectory`) that specify input data, the output format and the target directory for a conversion result. The **Convert**(`ConverterBuilder builder`) overloaded method applies the builder style setup of the conversion parameters using ConverterBuilder class.

using(var api = new HtmlApi(clientId, clientSecret))
{
    ConversionOptions xpsOpts = new XPSConversionOptions()
        .SetHeight(800)
        .SetWidth(1000)
        .SetLeftMargin(10)
        .SetRightMargin(10)
        .SetBottomMargin(10)
        .SetTopMargin(10);

    ConverterBuilder convHtmlXps = new ConverterBuilder()
        .FromLocalFile(srcFilePath)
        .To(xpsOpts)
        .SaveToStorage(destFolder);

    ConversionResult result = api.Convert(convHtmlXps);
    if(result.Status == "success" && result.Files.Length > 0)
