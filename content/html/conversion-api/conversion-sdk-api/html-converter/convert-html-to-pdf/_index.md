## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 provides the simplest API to convert {{%HTML%}} documents to {{%PDF%}} format with high quality, easy and fast. HTML to PDF conversion is often required to establish limited access to documents editing or copying, to produce official documentation, or send some information, for example, by email.

The article explains in a set of SDK examples how to convert an HTML document to PDF using Aspose.HTML Cloud client SDKs. We will consider various scenarios of HTML to PDF conversion: from storage to storage, from a local file system to the storage and from the Web to a local file system.

## **SDK Examples of HTML to PDF Conversion**

A widespread use case for Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK functions is file processing and converting. Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK allows you to fetch an HTML document from a storage location by its name, from a URL or a local file on your drive, convert it to a specified format and save it to the storage or a local drive. The following code examples demonstrate how to convert HTML to PDF for different cases using available SDKs.

### **Example 1.**  Convert an HTML file from the storage to PDF and save the result to the storage

The conversion process is following - a source document is loaded from the *default* cloud storage, and after conversion is completed, the result is saved to this storage. The default PDFConversionOptions are applied to the conversion. In the example, we use methods of the **ConverterBuilder** class: **FromStorageFile**(`inputPath`), **To**(`ConversionOptions`) and **SaveToStorageDirectory**(`outputDirectory`) that specify input data, the output format, and the target directory for a conversion result.

The following example demonstrates how to convert **HTML to PDF C#** language applying. HTML is taken from the cloud storage, converted to PDF and saved to the storage. You can download the C# SDK from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-html-cloud/aspose-html-cloud-dotnet).

```c#
// Create a ConverterBuilder instance and specify builder methods with parameters of conversion
ConverterBuilder builder = new ConverterBuilder()                   
    .FromStorageFile("/html_file.html")
    .To(new PDFConversionOptions())
    .SaveToStorageDirectory("/TestResult/Html");

// Initialize SDK API using the configuration builder          
using (var api = new HtmlApi(cb => cb
    .WithClientId(ClientId)            // from user Сredentials            
    .WithClientSecret(ClientSecret)))
{
    // Convert HTML to PDF            
    ConversionResult result = api.Convert(builder);

    if(result.Status == "success" && result.Files.Length > 0)
    {
        // Download file(s) by path result.Files 
    }
}
```

### **Example 2.** Convert HTML from the local file system to PDF with explicitly specified options and save to the storage

The example below demonstrates how to convert an HTML file from the local file system to PDF with explicitly specified options and save the result to the cloud storage.

 For conversion, we use methods of the **ConverterBuilder** class: **FromLocalFile**(`inputPath`), **To**(`ConversionOptions`) and **SaveToStorage**(`outputDirectory`) that specify input data, the output format, and the target directory for a conversion result. The **Convert**(`builder`) overloaded method applies the builder style setup of the conversion parameters using ConverterBuilder class.

ConverterBuilder builder = new ConverterBuilder()
    .FromLocalFile(@"Input\html_file.html")
    .To(pdfOpts)
    .SaveToStorageDirectory("/TestResult/Html/WithParams");

// Initialize SDK API using the configuration builder
using (var api = new HtmlApi(cb => cb
     .WithClientId(ClientId)              // from user Сredentials
     .WithClientSecret(ClientSecret)))
{
    // Convert HTML to PDF
	ConversionResult result = api.Convert(builder);

    if(result.Status == "success" && result.Files != null && result.Files.Length > 0)

### **Example 4.** Convert HTML to PDF from the local Directory and save the result to the local file system

Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK allows you to get an HTML file in the local directory, convert the directory to another format and save the result into the local file system. The example below demonstrates how to convert HTML to PDF with the default conversion parameters. The source "index.html" has linked files in the directory. A **ConvertLocalDirectory()** method converts synchronously a directory located in the local file system and specified by `directoryPath` parameter. This method takes as the parameters also the `startPoint`, `options` and `outputPath` that specify a file name in the directory to be converted, output format, and a path where the conversion result will be saved.

```c#
// Initialize SDK API in the builder style   
using (var api = new HtmlApi(cb => cb
    .WithClientId(ClientId)            // from user Сredentials
    .WithClientSecret(ClientSecret)))
{
    // Convert HTML to PDF
	Conversion.Conversion result = api.ConvertLocalDirectory(
        directoryPath: @"Input\DirectoryTests\HtmlSite2",
        startPoint: "index.html",
        options: new PDFConversionOptions(),
        outputPath: new LocalDirectoryParameter(@"Output\Dir\ConvertLocal"));

    if(result.Status == "completed" && result.Files.Length > 0)
    {
        // Download file(s) by path result.Files 
    }
}	
```

### **Example 5.** Convert HTML to PDF from the local Zip archive and save the result to the local file system

Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK allows you to get an HTML file with resources from Zip archive in the local file system, convert HTML to another format and save the result into the local file system. The example below demonstrates how to convert HTML to PDF with the default conversion parameters.
**ConvertLocalArchive()** method converts synchronously an HTML document in the ZIP archive located in the local file system. This method takes as the parameters `archivePath`, `startPoint`, `options` and `outputPath` that specify a source archive file path, a file name in the archive root directory to be converted, output format, and a path where the conversion result will be saved.

```c#
// Initialize SDK API in the builder style   
using (var api = new HtmlApi(cb => cb
    .WithClientId(ClientId)            // from user Сredentials
    .WithClientSecret(ClientSecret)))
{
    // Convert HTML to PDF
	Conversion.Conversion result = api.ConvertLocalArchive(
        archivePath: @"Input\ZipTests\test1.zip",
        startPoint: "index.html",
        options: new PDFConversionOptions(),
        outputPath: new LocalDirectoryParameter(@"Output\Zip\ConvertLocal"));

    if(result.Status == "completed" && result.Files.Length > 0)
    {
        // Download file(s) by path result.Files 
    }
}
```
