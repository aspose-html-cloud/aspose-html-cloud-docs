## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 provides the simplest API to convert  {{%EPUB%}} documents to {{%BMP%}} format with high quality, easy and fast. 

The EPUB format has gained popularity as an XML-based e-book format and designed to adapt the content's presentation to the reader device. It is implemented as an archive file consisting of XHTML files carrying the content, images and other supporting files. Sometimes, it is required to get an image instead of EPUB documents, such as making them portable and easily shared on various devices, creating a picture gallery from eBooks, etc.

The article explains in a set of code examples how to convert an EPUB document to BMP using Aspose.HTML Cloud client SDKs. We will consider various scenarios of EPUB to BMP conversion: from storage to storage, from a local file system to the storage and from the storage to a local file system.
