## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 provides the simplest API to convert  {{%EPUB%}} documents to {{%PDF%}} format with high quality, easy and fast. 

The EPUB format has gained popularity as an XML-based e-book format and designed to adapt the content's presentation to the reader device. It is implemented as an archive file consisting of XHTML files carrying the content, images and other supporting files. 
PDF is basically a static document that can contain text, images, form-fields,  media, digital signatures,  hyperlinks, etc. One of the PDF benefits is your paper will be presented exactly how you designed it out, and it is ideal for sending documents that are intended to be printed out.

The article explains in a set of code examples how to convert an EPUB document to PDF using Aspose.HTML Cloud client SDKs. We will consider various scenarios of EPUB to PDF conversion: from storage to storage, from a local file system to the storage and from the storage to a local file system.

All of the above SDKs are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-words-cloud/). Each repository contains a wide range of code examples to illustrate its usage.

## **SDK Examples of EPUB to PDF Conversion**

A widespread use case for Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK functions is file processing and converting.  Cloud SDK allows you to fetch an EPUB document from storage location by its name or a local file on your drive, convert it to a specified format and save it to the storage or a local drive. The following code examples demonstrate how to convert EPUB to PDF for different cases using available SDKs.

### **Example 1.**  Convert an EPUB file from the storage to PDF and save the result to the storage

The conversion process is following - a source document is loaded from the *default* cloud storage, and after conversion is completed, the result is saved to this storage.  The default PDFConversionOptions are applied to the conversion. In the example, we use methods of the **ConverterBuilder** class: **FromStorageFile**(`inputPath`), **To**(`ConversionOptions`) and **SaveToLocal**(`outputDirectory`) that specify input data, the output format and the target directory for a conversion result.

The following example demonstrates how to convert **EPUB to PDF C#** language applying. EPUB is taken from the cloud storage, converted to PDF and saved to the storage. You can download the C# SDK from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-html-cloud/aspose-html-cloud-dotnet).

```c#
const string StorageSrcFolder = "storage:///Html/TestData";
const string StorageDstFolder = "storage:///Html/TestResult";

var name = "example.epub";
var srcFilePath = $"{StorageSrcFolder}/{name}";
var destFolder = $"{StorageDstFolder}/Pdf";

using(var api = new HtmlApi(clientID, clientSecret)) // initialize SDK API
{
    ConverterBuilder bilder = new ConverterBuilder()
        .FromStorageFile(srcFilePath)
        .To(new PDFConversionOptions())
        .SaveToStorage(destFolder);

    ConversionResult result = api.Convert(bilder);
    if(result.Status == "success" && result.Files.Length > 0)
    {
        // download file(s) by path result.Files
    }
}
```

EPUB to PDF conversion occurs with the **default conversion options**: the resulting PDF documentâ€™s width and height correspond to A4, all margins have zero value, and Quality of jpeg compression is 95%.

### **Example 2.** Convert EPUB from the local file system to PDF with explicitly specified options and save to the storage

The example below demonstrates how to convert an EPUB file from the local file system to PDF format with explicitly specified options and save the result to the cloud storage.

 For conversion, we use methods of the **ConverterBuilder** class: **FromLocalFile**(`inputPath`), **To**(`ConversionOptions`) and **SaveToStorage**(`outputDirectory`) that specify input data, the output format and the target directory for a conversion result. The **Convert**(`ConverterBuilder builder`) overloaded method applies the builder style setup of the conversion parameters using ConverterBuilder class.

const string StorageDstFolder = "storage:///Html/TestResult";

var name = "example.epub";
var srcFilePath = $"{LocalTestData}\{name}";
var destFolder = $"{StorageDstFolder}/Pdf";

using(var api = new HtmlApi(clientId, clientSecret))
{
    ConversionOptions pdfOpts = new PDFConversionOptions()
        .SetHeight(800)
        .SetWidth(1000)
        .SetLeftMargin(10)
        .SetRightMargin(10)
        .SetBottomMargin(10)
        .SetTopMargin(10)
        .SetQuality(95);

    ConverterBuilder bilder = new ConverterBuilder()
        .FromLocalFile(srcFilePath)
        .To(pdfOpts)
        .SaveToStorage(destFolder);

    ConversionResult result = api.Convert(bilder);
    if(result.Status == "success" && result.Files.Length > 0)
    {
        // download file(s) by path result.Files
