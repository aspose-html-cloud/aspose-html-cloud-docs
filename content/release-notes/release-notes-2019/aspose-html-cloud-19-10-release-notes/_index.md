## **API changes In this release**
- Aspose.HTML Public Cloud API has been revised for following reasons: All ML related features such as Translation, OCR and Summarization are dependend on external services that are still under development, their features are partially experimental, so the related Aspose.HTML Cloud APIs often work unstable; thus, all API entries calling ML methods will be excluded. 
## **Enhancements**
- Conversion to images: possibility to specify alternative designation (alias) of output format has been added. Available aliases: JPEG: jpeg, jpg TIFF: ti", tif
