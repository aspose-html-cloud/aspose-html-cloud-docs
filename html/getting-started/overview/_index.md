**Welcome to the Aspose.HTML Cloud documentation section**

Aspose.HTML Cloud is a REST API for manipulating and converting the HTML documents.
Our REST API provides the following capabilities:

- Convert the source document into PDF or XPS format. The source document can be an HTML document from the cloud storage (also XHTML, MHTML, ePub, Markdown), or a Web page by its URL.
- Convert the source document into one of the image formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP.
- Convert Markdown file into HTML.
- Convert MHTML to HTML.



Also our REST API provides capabilities to manipulate files that are stored in the cloud storage associated with the user applications, such as:

- Upload and download files to/from the cloud storage.
- Check if a file or folder exists in the storage.
- Get a list of folders and files in the specified storage folder.
- Get a list of versions of specified file (if the given storage supports file versioning).
- Copy, move and delete files and folders in the cloud storage
- Check if a named storage exists and is accessible to the user and get the storage total and used disc space.

For more details about the storage API features, see [Storage](https://docs.aspose.cloud/html/geveloper-guide/storage) section
