**Welcome to the Aspose.HTML Cloud documentation section**

Aspose.HTML Cloud is a REST API for manipulating and converting HTML documents.
Our REST API provides the following capabilities:

- Converting a source document into  [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/) or [XPS](https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/xps/) format. The source document can be an [HTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/html/) document from the cloud storage (also [XHTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/xhtml/), [MHTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/mhtml/), [EPUB](https://docs.fileformat.com/ebook/epub/), [Markdown](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/md/)), or a Web page by its URL.
- Converting a source document into one of the image formats: [JPEG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/),  [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/), [TIFF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/),  [BMP](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/), [GIF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/).
- Converting a Markdown file into [HTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/html/).
- Convert [MHTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/mhtml/) to [HTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/html/).



Also, our REST API provides capabilities to manipulate files that are stored in the cloud storage associated with user applications, such as:

- Upload and download files to/from the cloud storage.
- Check if a file or folder exists in the storage.
- Get a list of folders and files in the specified storage folder.
- Get a list of versions of the specified file (if the given storage supports file versioning).
- Copy, move and delete files and folders in the cloud storage.
- Check if named storage exists and is accessible to the user and get the storage total and used disc space.

For more details about the storage API features, see the [Storage](https://docs.aspose.cloud/html/storage/) section.

## Deprecated REST API

The actual version of Aspose.HTML Cloud REST API is v.4.0. Old-style REST API v.3.0 is still available, but its features will be moved step by step to API v.4.0. They are not recommended to use now.

## **Cloud SDKs**
Cloud SDKs are wrappers around REST APIs in various programming languages, allowing you to process documents in the language of your choice quickly and easily, gaining all benefits of strong types and IDE highlights. Please check [Aspose.HTML GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-html-cloud/) for SDKs along with working examples, to get you started in no time. 



## **API Explorer**
The easiest way is to try out our API right away in your browser with the [Aspose.HTML for Cloud API Reference](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/html/).  It is a collection of Swagger documentation for the Aspose.HTML for Cloud APIs,  through which you can get information about all the resources in the API. It also provides testing and interactivity to our API endpoint documentation.
