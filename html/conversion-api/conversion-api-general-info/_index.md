## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 provides the simplest API to convert an [HTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/html/) page to one of the fixed-layout document formats (including  [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/), [XPS](https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/xps/) and [DOC/DOCX](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/docx/)) or one of the raster image formats (including [JPEG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/), [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/), [TIFF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/),  [BMP](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/), and  [GIF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/)).Â You can convert the HTML document to any of supported formats either from the storage by its name or from the web by its URL.

The main difference from API v3.0 are:

- conversion is considered as potentially long time operation, so new API provides an asynchronous mode of conversion;
- many conversion options that were available in API v3.0 have been reduced to only three possible API calls that makes development more straightforward.
