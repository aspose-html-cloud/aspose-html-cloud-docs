## **Summary**

Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 provides the simplest API to convert an [HTML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/html/) page to one of the fixed-layout document formats (including  [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/), [XPS](https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/xps/) and [DOC/DOCX](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/docx/)) or one of the raster image formats (including [JPEG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/), [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/), [TIFF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/),  [BMP](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/), and  [GIF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/)).Â You can convert the HTML document to any of supported formats either from the storage by its name or from the web by its URL.

The main differences from API v3.0 are:

- conversion is considered as potentially long time operation, so new API provides an asynchronous mode of conversion;
- many conversion options that were available in API v3.0 have been reduced to only three possible REST API calls that makes development more straightforward.

To help developers speed up their development, also a family of SDKs is available, including for C#, Java, C++, Python, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Java/Android and more.  



## SDK vs. REST API

The application developer can use Aspose.HTML Cloud v4.0 conversion functionality calling directly the REST API by HTTP requests or using a set of SDKs.

1. SDK is a preferable choice for faster development; the SDKs provide convenient set of methods for the most typical cases and hide many routine operations from a developer.
2. REST API is a low-level interface to work directly with the Aspose.HTML Cloud product service by HTTP requests. It provides a full control on the HTTP operation results, but it requires more routine work to prepare HTTP requests and handle responses.
