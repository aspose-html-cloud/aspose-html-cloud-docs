## Summary

Aspose.HTML Cloud allows you to work with documents saved on the cloud storage. The Aspose.HTML Cloud API is a REST-based API for wide usability on the web across platforms. 

This article provides a detailed description of REST API operations to manipulate files in the cloud storage, i.e. upload, download, copy, move or delete files. If storage supports file versioning, the is an option to operate with a specified file version.

## Cloud SDK family

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 
Install Aspose.HTML Cloud SDK for .NET via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.HTML-Cloud/).

Complete source code of Aspose.HTML SDK for .NET is freely available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-html-cloud/aspose-html-cloud-dotnet).

### SDK examples

#### Example 1: How to upload a file



The following example demonstrates how to upload a file by its local file system path to the specified storage.

```c#
HtmlApi api = new HtmlApi(appSID, appKey);  
StorageProvider storageApi = api.Storage;  // Storage API entry point

var storageName = "";       // default storage
var dataDir = "c:\\work\\testdata";
var name = "testpage1.html";
var remotefolder = "/HtmlTestData/Upload";
var localPath = Path.Combine(dataDir, name);

```

#### Example 2: How to download a file

The example below shows how to download a file from storage to the local file system.

```c#
var storageName = "";       // default storage
var folder = "/HtmlTestData";
var name = "testpage1.html";
var localPath = "c:\\work\\download";

// here the ConfigurationBuilder is used to initialize the SDK API object
var api = new HtmlApi(cb => cb
                      .WithAppSid(appSID)
                      .WithAppKey(appKey));  
var storageApi = api.Storage;  // Storage API entry point

var storagePath = $"{folder}/{name}";

storageApi.Download(storagePath, Path.Combine(localPath, name), storageName)
if(File.Exists(Path.Combine(localPath, name)))
{
    // ... check if file has been downloaded
}
```
