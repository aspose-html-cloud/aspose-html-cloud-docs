## Introduction

Cloud file storage provides a simple way to save and retrieval information securely at any time from any location. Besides giving space, cloud storage can protect your files and data from computer failure or other events that may cause the information to be lost. Storage services enable developers to store data in the cloud, relying on the authentication and other access features that control who can get to the data. If you need any information getting started with setting third party storage please refer to [Aspose Cloud UI Help Topics](https://docs.aspose.cloud/total/aspose-cloud-ui-help-topics/).

Aspose.HTML Cloud provides the API to access files and folders stored in the user associated Aspose cloud storage. 

The provided storage API of version 4.0 is an alternative interface to the same functionality as in API v.3.0. 

Storage API is divided into the following groups:

- [Storage common info access API](/html/storage-api/storage-props-api/)
- [Storage folder manipulation API](/html/storage-api/storage-folder-api/)
- [Storage file manipulation API](/html/storage-api/storage-file-api/)

 To obtain more information about each group of APIs and SDK usage examples, click the correspondent link.

## Available SDKs

Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-html-cloud) for a complete list of Aspose.HTML SDKs along with working examples, to get you started in no time. Please check [Available SDKs](/available-sdks/) article to learn how to add an SDK to your project.
