## **Aspose.HTML Cloud for .NET**
### **Fixed issues**
- Conversion API: when the source file is ZIP (archived HTML with local resources), conversion method returns incorrect result file extension, e.g. result is ZIP although its content is PDF.
### **Internal updates**
- Dynabic.Billing sub-module has been updated to the last version; since Billing subsystem interfaces were significantly changed, it impacted all REST API controllers and application setup, so they became unable to be built. Thus, all impacted code has been updated and retested.
